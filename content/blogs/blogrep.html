<p>This paper titled <strong>“Impact of COVID-19 on RTI, a comparative perspective from India to EU”</strong> delineates the wringing of Right to Information during the COVID-19 pandemic. It delves into the political, social, and economic situation of India and the EU to understand why information asymmetry was so rampant and whether the media was captured by the government (out of fear or bribery) or were the polices such that RTI was given a much lower stance and constantly left behind.</p>

<p><em>Article 2:</em></p>
<p>Although patents are aimed at providing benefits to the inventor, while keeping in mind the best interests of public, sometimes this rudimental optimal point of mutual benefit is not achieved. Reaching this point is a convoluted process; as it is where ethics and law converge. Not patenting a drug could lead to low levels of motivation amongst the investors, while patenting it could lead to unwarranted animal/human testing, lack of access of the drug, increase in costs, and other dilemmas regarding patenting genetic material.</p>
